## 💎 The V6.5 Philosophy
Unlike traditional template-based stores, Kynar Studio operates on a **Data-Driven Architecture**. Every product interaction is controlled by a centralized Vault, ensuring that the interface remains lean while the inventory grows.

### **Key Technical Features**
* **Vault-Sync Discovery:** A real-time search engine that filters through the `vault.js` database without page reloads.
* **Secure Gateway Delivery:** A protocol-driven claim system that decrypts asset paths only after authorization.
* **Clinical UI Physics:** Powered by Lenis Smooth Scroll and custom haptic feedback for a tactile mobile experience.
* **Boutique SEO:** Pre-configured with JSON-LD logic, Open Graph meta-tags, and a dynamic XML sitemap.
