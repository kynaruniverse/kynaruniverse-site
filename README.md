# 🏛 KYNAR STUDIO | V9.0 INDUSTRIAL ENGINE

Kynar Studio is a high-performance, boutique digital marketplace engineered for the creative elite. This repository contains the **V9.0 Engine**, featuring a fully "Overlay-Lifted" architecture for maximum mobile performance and SEO protection.

---

## 💎 The V9.0 Philosophy
Unlike traditional template-based stores, Kynar Studio operates on a **Data-Driven & Event-Wireless Architecture**.
* **Mobile-First Core:** Overlays (Cart/Nav) are injected at the root level to prevent CSS stacking context traps.
* **Wireless Logic:** Components communicate via a global `EventBus` rather than direct DOM coupling.
* **Vault-Sync Discovery:** A real-time search engine that filters through the `vault.js` database without page reloads.

### **Key Technical Features**

* **Vault-Sync Discovery:** A real-time search engine that filters through the `vault.js` database without page reloads.
* **Secure Gateway Delivery:** A protocol-driven claim system that decrypts asset paths only after authorization.
* **Clinical UI Physics:** Powered by Lenis Smooth Scroll and custom haptic feedback for a tactile mobile experience.
* **Boutique SEO:** Pre-configured with JSON-LD logic, Open Graph meta-tags, and a dynamic XML sitemap.

## 🛠️ Maintenance Protocol
To preserve the **High-Fidelity Handshake**, all additions to the shop must follow these rules:
1. **Geometric Integrity:** New product IDs in `vault.js` must be kebab-case and mirrored in `sitemap.xml`.
2. **Haptic Sync:** All new interactive triggers must include the `navigator.vibrate` handshake.
3. **Temporal Physics:** Update the `<lastmod>` tag in `sitemap.xml` after every inventory injection.
4. **Obsidian Handshake:** Never use hardcoded HEX/RGBA for UI elements; utilize `var(--ink-deep)` or `var(--bg-surface)` to ensure Dark Mode parity.
5. **Semantic Handshake:** Update the `@context` JSON-LD schema in `index.html` if the studio’s official URL or social handles are re-indexed.

## 🚀 Live Signal (Deployment)

* **Environment:** HTTPS Required for Haptic Engine (`navigator.vibrate`).
* **Caching:** Purge CDN (Cloudflare/Vercel) upon `vault.js` updates to sync discovery.
* **Compression:** WebP/Brotli enforced for ultra-low latency.
